# AES Secure - File Encryption and Decryption Program

## Overview
AES Secure is a Java-based program that utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files. It leverages Java's cryptography library to perform secure file operations. This program provides a simple and efficient way to encrypt sensitive data in files, ensuring confidentiality and security.

## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Encrypts files using the AES algorithm.
- **AES Decryption**: Decrypts encrypted files using the AES algorithm.
- **Secure File Handling**: Protects sensitive data by encrypting files before storage.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of command-line usage.
- Familiarity with Java programming.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

## Usage
### Encryption
To encrypt a file, run the following command:
Replace `/path/to/input/file.txt` with the path to the file you want to encrypt and `/path/to/output/encryptedFile.aes` with the desired output path and filename for the encrypted file.

### Decryption
To decrypt an encrypted file, execute the command:
Replace `/path/to/encryptedFile.aes` with the path to the encrypted file and `/path/to/output/decryptedFile.txt` with the desired output path and filename for the decrypted file.

## Important Notes
- Ensure you keep the encryption key secure and don't lose it, as it's necessary for decryption.
- Back up the original files before encryption to prevent data loss.
